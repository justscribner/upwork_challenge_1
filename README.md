## Challenge

Thank you for your interest in helping us on this project. We have a little challenge for you to complete to show off your abilities. Within the next 24 hours please provide a working Task Management App using React & Redux w/ CSS Grid (Not Flexbox). Any other UI or design libraries are up to you. The app requirements are as follows:

- Ability to add tasks and mark them completed.
- Must have an option for adding notes on the task.
- Must have a working time tracking system w/ a start task and task completed button. The data does not have to persist through refresh of the browser but the state of the hours/time being tracked does need to be managed by redux (You can use the context API or Flux if you want to).

### Running

`npm install` - install deps

`npm run start` - run app on http://localhost:3000
